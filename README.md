# Project_Slayer
*Working Title, of course*
---
The general idea of this project will be to demonstrate our team's ability to build and API that databases scales, modes and chords as well as a frontend system which users can 
use to fetch the information through a series of drop down menus or a simple search engine.
---
for example:
database:
```
{
scales: [
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "a natural minor",
    degress: {
      "1": "a",
      "2": "b",
      "3": "c",
      "4": "d",
      "5": "e",
      "6": "f",
      "7": "g"
      }
   }
]
```
frontend:
```
tbd
```
